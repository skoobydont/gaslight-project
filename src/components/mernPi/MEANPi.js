                <p>MEAN is an acronym for the JavaScript stack consisting of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>MongoDB</li>
                    <li>Express</li>
                    <li>AngularJS / ReactJS</li>
                    <li>Node.js</li>
                </ul>
                <p>MEAN is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web sites and web applications.</p>
                <p>Because all components of the MEAN stack support programs that are written in JavaScript, one language can be used to develop both server-side and client-side execution environments</p>
                <p>This component will document the process of my research and implementation of the MERN Stack on a Raspberry Pi</p>
                <small>(I have more experience with React over Angular; even though saying that I'm working on a MEAN Pi sounds cooler)</small>
