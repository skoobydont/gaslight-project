#This project is designed to demonstrate React.js framework capabilities and share insight on many of the security components used in network security.

I have since expanded it to include Text Encryption with the Node library cryptr and plan to document my progress learning the MEAN stack (substituting AngularJS for ReactJS).

To get started:
<ol>
    <li>Clone the repository to your machine</li>
    <li>Check that node is installed with <code>npm -v</code> or <code>npm --version</code>
    <li>Navigate to the project folder with <code>cd react-it-team</code></li>
    <li>Install necessary node modules with <code>npm install</code></li>
    <li>Start the node server with <code>npm start</code></li>
    <li>You can then find the application running on port 3000</li>
</ol>
