This project is designed to demonstrate React.js framework capabilities and share insight on many of the security components used in network security.

I have since expanded it to include Text Encryption with the Node library cryptr and plan to document my progress learning the MERN stack.

While the majority of the application and api files can be found within this project, I am working on deploying the application to a <a href="https://www.heroku.com/free" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Heroku</a> application instance and consume a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">MongoDB Atlas</a> database (currently reseasrching more about the process behind moving everything)
